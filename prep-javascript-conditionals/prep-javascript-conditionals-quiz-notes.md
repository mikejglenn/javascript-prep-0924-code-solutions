## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What does `strictly equal` mean?
  In JavaScript, the strict equality operator (===) checks if two values are equal, without performing any type coercion. This means both the value and the type of the operands must be the same for the comparison to return true.

- What is the logical **and** operator?
  The logical and (&&) (logical conjunction) operator for a set of boolean operands will be true if and only if all the operands are true. Otherwise it will be false.

- Can you name some comparison operators?
  ==, ===, !=, !==, >, <, >=, <=
