## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What data types can object properties hold?
  A property key (name) is always a string, but the value can be any data type, like strings, numbers, booleans, or complex data types like arrays, function and other objects.

- Describe the syntax (structure) of object-literals in JavaScript.
  JavaScript objects can also be created using the Object Literal Syntax. You use curly braces ({}) to surround the keys and values in the object, then within the braces you add each key followed by a colon (:), followed by its value. Finally, each key/value pair is separated by a comma (,).
